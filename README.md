### Hi there 👋

My name is José Castor from Brazil (BR). I've been working as a developer since 2005.

I am developer for TOTVS Fluig, and like any tech lover.

I love to study and always be in front of new challenges, right now I'm studying Data Engineer, front and backend languages (reactjs, angular, vuejs, nodejs and python)

In my free time I like to watch (🎞️), series (📺), drink beer (🍺) with my friends and parents.

Would you like to find me?
